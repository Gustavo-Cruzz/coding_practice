Coding practice problems from Advent of Code 2022, Beecrowd and my Computer Engeneering undergraduation

Beecrowd's challenges are found in OBI folde, which stands for "Olímpiada Brasileira de Informática", a nation-wide coding challenge held annually in Brazil.

Most of the Undergrad activities will be in Data Structures folder, but it might change once tasks get more complex and other kinds of challenges start coming by.

Plans for this repo include more Python and Rust code on various tasks, and also Mysql
